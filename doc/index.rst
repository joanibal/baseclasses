The ``baseClasses`` repository contains common definitions for
aerodynamic, structural and aerostructural solvers, as well as classes
defining standard ways of describing aerodynamic, structural and
aerostructural problems for use in those classes.

To install, first clone the repo, then go into the root directory and type::

   pip install .

For stability we recommend cloning or checking out a tagged release.
